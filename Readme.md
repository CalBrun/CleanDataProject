Readme for run_analysis.R

The run_analysis.R script should be run in the directory that you wish to download the raw data file to, and will download and unzip the data into that directory.
The script creates a tidy data set.within the directory called “tidyfile.txt”, from the raw data.  The tidy data is the result of manipulating the raw data to:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. Extract only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Adding the descriptive activity names;
4. Labelling the data set with descriptive variable names; and
5. Creating the “tidyfile.txt” as an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
